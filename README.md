# Lambda Players - Player Administration System

An addon for Lambda Players that adds the ability for server admins to administrate Lambdas using the scoreboard / chat commands.

Use at your own risk for now. It is very *work in progress* and currently overrides the scoreboard provided by the Lambda Players.
