# Lambda Players - Player Administration System

An addon for Lambda Players that adds the ability for server admins to administrate Lambdas using the scoreboard / chat commands.

This is not an addon that will make Lambda Players able to administrate the server.

It currently overrides the scoreboard provided by the Lambda Players due to the implementation of the ability to right click on scoreboard icons to do certain actions on Lambda Players.
